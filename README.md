This repository showcases a data narrative developed as part of the ES-114, Probability, Statistics and Data Visualization course at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar. The project applies clustering, classification, and regression techniques using Python's Scikit-Learn library to extract valuable insights. Tools such as covariance matrices, correlation factors, and principal component analysis (PCA) drive the analysis, integrating concepts from probability, statistics, and data visualization. Developed in April 2024, this project underscores the practical application of ES-113, Data-Centric Computing course in a real-world dataset. Explore the code, datasets, and final report to dive deeper into the analysis.
